## User Story / Deliverables

As a user, I will see a list view of movie cards that include the movie title, genre, score out of 10, link to trailer, an image of the movie poster, runtime, rating, a button with the text “X”, and button with the text “watch me!”
As a user, there will be a dropdown with different movie genres that when clicked, sorts the movies in my library/list and in the list view by genre
As a user, I will click the movie card and that will give me a show view of only that card, which I can then decide if I want to add it to my library/list by clicking the “watch me!” button or I can click the “return home” button (which will be added to card in show view) to go back to the list view of movies and my library/list of movies using client side routing to enter show view and exit show view
As a user, I will be able to click on the “watch me!” button to add that movie card to my movie library/list which will persist when the page is refreshed
As a user, I will be able to click the “remove from movie library” button to remove the movie card JUST from the movie library and puts it back in the list view with the rest of the movie cards
As a user, I will be able to click the “X” button to remove the movie card from either the list view or my movie library/list

## Pitch:

We will be creating the ability for users to create their own movie library where users can choose which movies to add and remove from their library.
